# Lessons learned
(This manifestation of) Bucephalus was a success in that I have a much better understanding of the features
that I am looking for in this kind of software. These are some of the lessons I have learned.

## The good
 * I like the templating features of `bucvac`.
 * I like `/v/coffee`.
 * Random long and short fortunes.
 * Archiving things worked perfectly.
 * Tags worked well.
 * Geogebra embedding was useful, I wish I had a better use for it.
 * The task manager (`buctask`) worked well and I used it a lot.
 * Pinning a document to the front page. (I like the restriction to a single thing.)
 * The idea of a recent documents page.

## The bad
 * No way of 'linking' related documents together in a linear way.
 * No way of hyperlinking between documents easily.
 * No way of storing related documents/files together (e.g. images with source code).
 * Running `bucvac` was really slow.
 * No way of linking to external URLs easily so I could find them again.
 * JSON databases are not scalable.

## The ugly
 * Search!
 * The document interface (the iframe holding PDF) was clunky.
 * The document storage backend was kind of hacky.
 * Version control is hard when storing PDFs.
 * The implementation of the recent docs page was really hacky.
